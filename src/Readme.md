# LING 406 Term Project - Sentiment Analyzer
## This program performs Positive/Negative sentiment analysis on a corpus of movie reviews. It uses k-fold cross validation on different machine learning models to determine the accuracy of each model.
## To run the program, first make sure your working directory contains two the subdirectories /Code/ and /Data/. The Code directory contains the Jupyter Notebook files baseline.ipynb (the baseline SA analyzer) and improvedSA.ipynb (the improved SA analyzer), and the Data directory contains the tar.gz files review_polarity.tar.gz and NRC-Sentiment-Emotion-Lexicons.tar.gz. Run either Jupyter Notebook to open and extract the tar.gz files, run the analyzer, and print the accuracy results.
